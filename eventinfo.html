<p></p>

<h2>VEGAN FOOD DRIVE</h2>
<p>Rochester’s Food Not Bombs will be collecting non-perishable foods free of meat and animal products. 

Food Not Bombs recover food that would have been discarded and share it as a way of protesting war and poverty. They also reduce food waste and meet the direct need in our community by collecting discarded food, preparing vegan meals that they share with the hungry while providing literature about the need to change our society. Food Not Bombs also provide food to protesters, striking workers and organize food relief after natural and political crisis.</p>
